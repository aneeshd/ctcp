Day to Day bugs/fixes:
* RTO congestion timeout stuff... [minji]
* Fix server restart - related to prev point [minji]
* Fix bug from commit 54a88d8 [done~ish] -> Still getting dof_remain = -1 when requesting extra dofs
* Measurements - fix the grapher to measure the coded file transfer [done]

New Big Features:
* Multiple sources
* Experiment with vectorized SSE instruction for FFmult [try this - long discussion]
* Handshake
* Dynamic coding window

API/Porting:
* Try to port to Mac/Windows - Ubuntu wireless driver is crap

Grapher:
* Fix grapher's bw computations
* Add things to the grapher:

  - BW
  - Congestion Window

  - Block transitions

  - DOFs sent per block

  - Loss rate SLR
  - RTT, RTO, SRTT, base rtt
  - When a block got decode



Documentation:
* Fix README
* Setup redmine in plato
* Fix usage function in clictcp

Misc:
	* Erase the repo from origin
        * Read about tcpdump/netstat/etc try to figure out how to measure the tcp connection performance
