* [DONE] Swap names atoucli and atousrv
* [DONE] Server listens to the socket and waits for the client to request for a transmission -> back to listen.
* [DONE] Running the atoucli sends a requests and receives everything
* [DONE] Update the usage of atoucli and atousrv 
* [IGNORED] Client can send more than one request at a time -> Involves annoying multithreading that is not needed right now.
* Rename db.tmp to be receiver and time dependent
* Clean the state of the server after the client is done. STILL NEED TO TEST RESET
* [DONE] Minor cleanup on the client side (renaming cli_addr to srv_addr etc)
* [DONE] Changing the client request to ask for a particular file to be transmitted
* Add checksum
